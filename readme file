CodeAlpha Graphics Internship
As part of my CodeAlpha Graphics Design Internship, I worked on a range of creative projects that showcase my design and branding expertise. 
From crafting a clean, tech-inspired flyer for computer repair services to designing the futuristic CyberWave logo, 
I focused on combining aesthetics with functionality. Additionally, I created a business innovation guide that simplifies complex
ideas through a professional and visually engaging layout. My GitHub portfolio features these projects and more, demonstrating my skills in graphic design, 
branding, and user-centered solutions.
